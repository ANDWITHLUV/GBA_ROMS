This ROM allows a user to input hue/saturation/value information that will then be converted, automatically, to RGB values acceptable on a GBA. Users can store these values by pressing the start button while highlighting one of the swatches on the far left of the screen. There are 64  palettes each with 15 swatches - the 0 swatch on a GBA is transparent. Users can view these palettes/swatches by pressing select. The second page can be navigated by pressing the left and right direction pad buttons. Palettes are shown 4 at a time in groups of five. The values displayed represent HexDeci 16 bit numbers 0x0000. Users can use the first page to verify that their HSV input matches the RGB output at the lower right hand side of the screen. Values here range from 0..255. They are then converted into the range of 0..31. Then they are combined to make a 16 bit number in Hexadecimal 0x0000.
